Some Basic Python concepts @ basic_python file:

- Variables store data
    
- Lists are mutable, ordered collections
    
- Tuples are immutable, ordered collections

- Dictionaries store key-value pairs
    
- Sets contain unique, unordered elements
    
- For loops iterate over collections
    
- Functions define reusable code blocks
    
- If statements control program flow based on conditions

3. **Git & Github**: Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git. It's like a social network for code. Included a file **git Cheatsheet**
