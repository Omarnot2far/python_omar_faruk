# Advanced Python: Data analysis and machine learning @ stepbystepcompetence.se

The course covers the use of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib in 5 weeks.

# Week-1: 

Introduction of

1: **Anaconda**: A platform of data science where all the tools are included. Learned about Installation.

2: **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupiter Notebook is a webbased environment which can be found in Anaconda Platform where you write Python code and execute.
  
Some Basic Python concepts @ basic_python file:

- Variables store data
    
- Lists are mutable, ordered collections
    
- Tuples are immutable, ordered collections

- Dictionaries store key-value pairs
    
- Sets contain unique, unordered elements
    
- For loops iterate over collections
    
- Functions define reusable code blocks
    
- If statements control program flow based on conditions

3. **Git & Github**: Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git. It's like a social network for code. Included a file **git Cheatsheet**

# Learning NumPy and OpenCV (cv2)

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. Here's what we've learned:

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of our images.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For advanced image processing tasks.
- **urllib**: For fetching images from URLs.

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Image Retrieval**: 
   - Fetching images from URLs using `urllib`.
   - Converting byte data to NumPy arrays.

2. **Image Representation**:
   - Understanding images as 3D NumPy arrays (height, width, color channels).
   - Converting between BGR and RGB color spaces.

3. **Image Manipulation**:
   - Resizing images using cv2.resize().
   - Accessing image dimensions and pixel values.
   - Modifying specific pixel values based on conditions.

4. **Array Operations**:
   - Copying arrays to avoid modifying original data.
   - Reshaping arrays (flattening a 2D image to 1D).

5. **Visualization**:
   - Using Matplotlib to display images.

## Code Highlights

- Created a function to fetch and process images from URLs.
- Implemented a function to resize images and extract dimensions.
- Demonstrated pixel manipulation.
- Showed how to flatten image array.

## Future Learning Directions

- OpenCV functions for image processing.
- image filtering and edge detection algorithms.
- image segmentation and object detection.
- computer vision tasks
